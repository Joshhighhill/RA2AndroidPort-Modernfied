# ra2assets + ra2engine

A portable C++17 library that decodes Red Alert 2 / Yuri's Revenge game data
(`ra2assets`: MIX archives, PAL palettes, SHP sprites, LZO/LCW map packs, INI,
rules, `.map` cell grids, TMP theater tiles), plus `ra2engine` — an SDL2
front-end that renders a real stock map with real theater terrain and lets you
select and move a unit (A\* pathfinding + walk animation). The library stays
pure and dependency-free; only the engine links SDL2.

## Building

Prerequisites: CMake 3.20+, MinGW-w64 gcc, Ninja, Python 3.13. The engine also
pulls SDL2 via CMake `FetchContent` (pinned `release-2.30.9`), built from source
on first configure.

Configure and build with CMake + Ninja:
```bash
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja
cmake --build build
```

Run tests (PowerShell — the compiled test exe must be launched from PowerShell,
not Git Bash, on this Windows setup; set `RA2_INSTALL_DIR` to exercise the
real-asset tests, otherwise they skip cleanly):
```powershell
$env:RA2_INSTALL_DIR = "D:\Red Alert 2"
& .\build\ra2assets_tests.exe
```

## Engine (desktop)

`ra2engine` reads your own legally-owned game files at run time via
`RA2_INSTALL_DIR` (default `D:\Red Alert 2`); no assets are bundled or
committed. It loads a real temperate stock map (`mapsmd03.mix` entry
`0x133a0cb2`, 103×110), the temperate theater tiles/palette
(`ra2.mix → isotemp.mix`, `isotem.pal`), and the GI infantry
(`conquer.mix/gi.shp` + `cache.mix/unittem.pal`, resolved via `rulesmd.ini`
unit `E1`).

Build and run (PowerShell):
```powershell
cmake --build build --target ra2engine
$env:RA2_INSTALL_DIR = "D:\Red Alert 2"
& .\build\ra2engine.exe
```

Interactive controls: tap/click the unit to select it (green marker); click a
destination to path-find and walk there; drag to pan the camera; arrow keys
also pan; Esc/close quits.

Headless/verification CLI modes (render one or more frames and exit):
- `ra2engine.exe --screenshot <out.png>` — render one frame of the map+unit to a PNG.
- `ra2engine.exe --demo-move <cellX> <cellY>` — select the unit, path to the cell, run the sim to arrival, write `task12_start.png`/`task12_end.png` to the scratchpad.
- `ra2engine.exe --demo-retarget <x1> <y1> <x2> <y2>` — order a move, retarget mid-walk, confirm arrival at the second target.

## Android (arm64-v8a) cross-compile

This proves the library is portable: the same sources in `src/` build for
Android via the NDK's own CMake toolchain file, with no source changes.
There is no app and no on-device run here — artifact inspection only
(confirming `libra2assets.so` is a real AArch64 ELF shared object).

Prerequisites: Android NDK r27c for Windows
(https://dl.google.com/android/repository/android-ndk-r27c-windows.zip),
unzipped so that `$ANDROID_NDK_HOME/build/cmake/android.toolchain.cmake`
exists, e.g.:

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://dl.google.com/android/repository/android-ndk-r27c-windows.zip" -OutFile "D:\android-ndk-r27c-windows.zip"
Expand-Archive -Path "D:\android-ndk-r27c-windows.zip" -DestinationPath "D:\"
$env:ANDROID_NDK_HOME = "D:\android-ndk-r27c"
```

Configure and build the library targets (the test/CLI executables reference
`RA2_INSTALL_DIR` game-install paths meant for the host and aren't part of
this cross-build):

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build-android -G Ninja `
  -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="$env:ANDROID_NDK_HOME/build/cmake/android.toolchain.cmake" `
  -DANDROID_ABI=arm64-v8a -DANDROID_PLATFORM=android-24 `
  -DRA2_BUILD_SHARED=ON
cmake --build build-android --target ra2assets ra2assets_so
```

`RA2_BUILD_SHARED=ON` additionally builds `ra2assets_so` (installed as
`libra2assets.so`), a shared target compiled from the same sources as the
static `ra2assets` library, so the resulting `.so` actually contains the
library's real code (verifiable with `llvm-nm`/`llvm-readelf`), proving the
sources are portable to Android/arm64 as an ELF shared object too, not just
as a static archive. Verify the result is AArch64:

```powershell
python -c "
import struct
with open('build-android/libra2assets.so','rb') as fh:
    m = fh.read(20)
assert m[:4] == b'\x7fELF'
machine = struct.unpack('<H', m[18:20])[0]
print('machine=0x%x' % machine, 'AArch64' if machine == 0xB7 else 'NOT-ARM64')
"
```

Expected output: `machine=0xb7 AArch64`.

## Preflight Check

Verify the game install and binary before RE/oracle work:
```bash
RA2_INSTALL_DIR="D:\Red Alert 2" python scripts/preflight.py
```

The script checks that `gamemd.exe` exists and matches the expected SHA1 hash for YR 1.001.
