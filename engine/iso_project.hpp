// RA2/TS diamond isometric projection.
//
// PURE math -- no SDL/OS deps. Compiled into both `ra2assets_tests` (so it
// is unit-testable without SDL/a window) and `ra2engine` (the real
// renderer, Task 9, and hit-testing, Task 12, both call these functions
// directly). See CMakeLists.txt: engine/iso_project.cpp is added as a
// source to both targets rather than living inside the ra2assets library,
// since it is engine-layer (screen space), not asset-parsing.
//
// Orientation / convention (confirmed against OpenRA's TS `Map` diamond
// projection, D:\ra2-re\reference\OpenRA -- OpenRA's MPos/CPos -> screen
// shear also moves +X right+down and +Y left+down along the two diamond
// edges, i.e. `(x - y)` scales the horizontal half-width and `(x + y)`
// scales the vertical half-height): given a cell (cell_x, cell_y) in the
// map's raw IsoMapPack5 grid space (see MapFile / map.hpp) and a height
// `level` (RA2 terrain height step, e.g. cliffs/ramps):
//
//   px = (cell_x - cell_y) * (tile_w / 2)
//   py = (cell_x + cell_y) * (tile_h / 2) - level * level_px
//
// Increasing `level` raises the tile on screen, so its contribution is
// SUBTRACTED from py (screen +y is down). Cell (0,0) is the screen origin
// (0,0); this is the "top-left of the tile's bounding rect" convention
// used consistently by both functions below (i.e. it is defined purely by
// the half-extent shear above -- there is no additional offset applied).
// The renderer (Task 9) adds its own camera/scroll translation on top of
// this pixel.
//
// `screen_to_cell` is the exact algebraic inverse of the level-0 case
// (level/height is ignored on the way back, since a screen pixel alone is
// height-ambiguous): solving the 2x2 linear system
//   px = (x - y) * hw,  py = (x + y) * hh   (hw = tile_w/2, hh = tile_h/2)
// for x, y gives
//   x = (px/hw + py/hh) / 2
//   y = (py/hh - px/hw) / 2
// rounded to the nearest integer cell. Because cell_to_screen and
// screen_to_cell are each other's exact inverse by construction, round-trip
// (cell -> screen -> cell) is exact for every integer cell whenever
// tile_w/tile_h are even (both stock RA2 tile sizes, 60x30 and 48x24, are).
