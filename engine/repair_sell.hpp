// gamemd.exe -- docs/re/repair-sell.md (§ refs inline). World-free and
// SDL-free: this TU sees only Building/BuildingTypeDef, exactly like
// production.cpp and factory.cpp, so every number below is host-doctestable.
//
// THE THREE TRAPS this file exists to make impossible to re-introduce:
//   1. the repair interval is trunc(RepairRate*900) = 14, NOT 15 (__ftol
//      truncates 14.4) and it is a GLOBAL frame phase, not a per-building timer;
//   2. stepCost uses TWO INTEGER divisions -- the naive
//      cost*percent*damage_fraction form is ~17% wrong on a Construction Yard;
//   3. the sell refund has NO health term at all.
